# OIDC Authenticator Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and fill in your values

# OIDC Provider Settings
issuer: "https://your-oidc-provider.com/"
clientId: "your-client-id"
organizationId: "org_xxxxx"  # Optional: for Auth0 multi-tenant
scopes: "openid profile email offline"

# Local Callback Server
callback:
  port: 8000

# Backend Integration
# Where to send tokens after successful authentication
backend:
  url: "http://localhost:7007"
  endpoint: "/api/cluster-auth/tokens"  # Token submission endpoint

# Token Bypass (Optional - skips OIDC flow if provided)
# Provide both access_token and id_token from a previous OIDC flow
# If both tokens are provided, OIDC flow is skipped entirely
# If tokens are not provided (or commented out), normal OIDC flow is used
# tokens:
#   accessToken: "eyJhbGciO..."
#   idToken: "eyJhbGci..."

# NOTE: When tokens are provided:
# - OIDC flow is completely skipped
# - Tokens are sent directly to backend
# - Daemon responds immediately without browser redirect
# - Both tokens are from OIDC authentication, NOT Kubernetes service account tokens
# - Access token is typically JWE encrypted, ID token is JWT
# - You can get these tokens by running normal OIDC flow once with --verbose --output
